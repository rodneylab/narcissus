  Narcissus Blog
</h1>

Narcissus is a proof of concept backend as a service app which lets you create a blog site quicker by managing important blog features like comment and message forms as well as post views and likes.

This demo Svelte site is static and uses Serverless Rust Cloudflare Workers to read and create comments as well as other interactive elements using REST requests, adding spam detection and Captchas without the added hassle of adding spam detection and Captchas. The app is backed by a Supabase PostgreSQL database.
